## Some organisational stuff
Programming language used so far: Python3.6
(if you don't have it I recommend to get it, some cool things like f-strings in there ;) )

Virtual environments are always a good habit for programming projects.
They don't interfere with the installed packages and you can easily set them up using the
requirements.txt file from the repo (pip install -r requirements.txt)
