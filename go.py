"""Some first steps towards the GO bot

GO_game is a class that represents a match of GO, including the current board,
a history of all boards and moves, and checking of validity of moves.
It also evaluates the area/territory, according to japanese or chinese rules.

I did my best on the docstrings, and I used some type-annotation from time to
time! Python supports that since 3.?, but it's just used by linters and it
does not affect the code in any way during the runtime (afaik).
